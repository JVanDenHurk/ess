And then, the woods, the creature, the underground chamber, the game - everything disappears - we leave it all somewhere far behind.\n\nWe're in a rift, filled with nothing but light. We crawl out...\n\nWe're no longer in the forest. It dissolves into the past, like a dream after awakening. We're in a city now. But... Can we wake up inside a dream? If we're awake, we shouldn't be dreaming, but our surroundings suggest otherwise.\n\nThis city is unlike any we know. Houses scrape a sky full of bulky airships. The moon is too large or too close, and a huge, mechanical construction connects it to the ground. Neon lamps buzz and sparkle, inviting us to step inside colourful shops. Someone approaches - a mixture of human and rat.\n\n\"Ah, never mind. For a brief moment, I thought you didn't have a face. You have one, right? Such a silly idea! Sorry,\" the creature says and shakes a bottle in its hand. \"Have a wonderful night, person-with-a-face.\"\n\nVictory. Each Dreamer cures 2 and Unseals 2 cards. Remember that to unseal cards you take them from the top of your Sealed Cards pile and place them into your Discard Pile.\n\nWe stand in this gigantic, mysterious city, dumbfounded. And then a memory forms at the edge of our minds.\n\nFind all cards II-41 L. Each Dreamer gains their corresponding First Memory card - these provide each Dreamer with a goal that, when completed, reveals a little bit more about their lost memories. Leftover First Memory cards (related to Dreamers who are not actually in play) are placed in the Storage. If the related Dreamers join the game later, they gain their First Memory card from the Storage.\n\nNow, it's time to change the game slightly. Don't forget to resolve all of the following steps! There are many of them because, in addition to rewarding you, they will add many basic elements to the game.\n\nSet aside Card D and TILES S & T remaining from the Dream. Then discard the current Dreamscape (the map tiles on the board currently) and remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the Dream Gate tile of this Dream. If there are any Item Cards that you did not find (hint: did you check the floorboards?), add them to the Item Market (separate to the Item Deck). There is no space for this on the board so place is off to the side where you will remember. You can place the other removed cards in the larger well inside the core game box.\n\nFind the 4 tiles II-36 A. Two of them have \"Starting\" written on their back side - these are the 2 Setup Slumber Map tiles, and they are always placed face-up first on the Slumber Map (where the Dreamscape was before). You can do that now. Shuffle the others and make a Slumber Map deck from them.\n\nNote that this DREAMSCAPE MAP is separate to the DREAMWORLD MAP which we'll be placing later.\n\nThe easiest way to remember this difference is to think DREAMSCAPE = LANDSCAPE which is smaller in scale vs DREAMWORLD = WORLD which is larger in scale.\n\nFind tiles: II-37 A, B, C, and D. One of them, II-37 A, is a little different (it has a green back), set it aside and shuffle the other tiles and make a slumber deck. Place this green tile at the bottom of the stack after you've done that and place the deck on the allocated spot on the board (or off to the side if not using a board).\n\nWhere to start our search? Fragments of our previous training break through the barrier of oblivion - we knew that we would be in this situation. Now we have to choose which path to take. We have two options: start an investigation to \"find someone who can know what's going on\" or \"look inside ourselves, and maybe there we'll find the answers\". So, we can go into the city or meditate on our problems somewhere surrounded by nature.\n\nGain Dream Gates tiles II-39 B (\"Not alone in the dark\") and II-39 O (\"I'll never forget those sunshine days\"). These tiles allow you to enter unique Dreams if you travel to their Locations on the Dreamworld Map tiles and spend the required number of Keys (more on this later as well). You have a special envelope for keeping Dream Gate tiles.\n\nYou'll need several more things to travel through the Dreamworld Map:\n\nGain card D which we set aside earlier. This is the Dreamworld Map Wisdom card. Place it in the Wisdom cards holder. You'll use this rules reference as a guide to travel through the Dreamworld Map (which we'll cover soon).\n\nOr if you are playing with version 2.0:\n\nGain tiles S and T which we also set aside earlier. These are your first 2 Dreamworld Map tiles: Suburbia and Metropolis. You have to place them in the corresponding spots on the Dreamworld Map board. They represent the first 2 districts of the Dreamworld.\n\nEach Dreamer gains 3 ('ether'). If you haven't gained these yet, they represent the experience Dreamers can gain as they explore the Dream World. They can be used to buy additional Influence Cards and to pay for certain other effects. To spend these you'll need:\n\nGain the 3 cards II-41 C. These are Note cards so you should keep them in the Storage. These particular 3 cards allow you to make purchases if you're in a Shopping Location on the Dreamworld Map. When you go shopping for influence cards, draw 3 Influence cards from the influence market deck and buy as many of these as you want, paying their costs. If you choose to buy none, you gain a instead. Shopping for items is similar - except you only draw 1 random item from the Item Market deck and the cost to obtain it is 2 . You may have no items available currently depending on whether you found them in the 1st Dream or not.\n\nA little more to go.\n\nFind the 6 cards II-41 I and make a Seasons deck from them. Place it on the Seasons slot - you can find it near the Dreamworld Map board. Seasons will change during the campaign, but for now, find the Ordinary Days card and place it face-up on the top of the Seasons deck.\n\nFind card II-41 M. It's the Awakening Wisdom card - place it in the Wisdom cards holder.\n\nAnd now, to begin the campaign, resolve the Awakening - just follow the steps on the Awakening Wisdom card (except for setting up the Slumber map - you've done that already :) ). Awakening is a rest mechanic that can be performed after resolving a location effect on the Dreamworld Map that allows you to restore your Dreamer's stamina, removing their distress and sealed cards at the cost of progress (all their active Progress cards are reset along with losing all keys and ). Note that at NO point during this do you draw influence cards into your hand.\n\nAfter you've done that, your team marker should be on the Awakening Space on the B2 Dreamworld Map tile: Suburbia. Now what do I do!? - s.133.1",

But if you don't have that much (but at least for 1 basic cost - in this case, it's 3 ) - you may pay it and place 1 next to this action. It means it's paid once. When you or other Dreamers pay the rest, then you can use this action.\n\nIf you didn't make any mistake and paid the right cost - place 1 on the Dream Gate tile (the large square card with \"Gate to the First Dream\" on it).\n\nAfter using this action, discard all the that lie next to this action. If not for the icon, you would be able to pay and use this action again to gain another , but you can't.\n\nThe icon before the cost means that you have to mark it with a token after using it for the first time. When there's a token on an action, you can't use it anymore until the end of this Dream.",

        "text": "Below interactions, there are 3 Entity effects that this Entity performs in the Dreamscape Phase: Morphing, Basic, and Special, in addition to its Movement.\n\nAs you can see, they correspond to Steps on the Turn cards.\n\nWhen Dreamers finish their actions in each Turn, the Dreamscape Phase takes effect. You do this by resolving the current Turn card (the face up card on the top of your Turn deck). Resolve all Steps from the current Turn card in order. Steps may trigger some of the Entity's effects. For example, the first Turn may be: Movement> Special effect> Morphing effect, and the second one may be: Basic effect> Basic effect again> Movement. Each Turn is different from the others.\n\nThis Entity has no Morphing effects available (as it would make it too powerful for you now otherwise). If a specific Entity doesn't have some of the effects, treat them as if they do nothing when they should be resolved. Morphings are basically power ups that make Entities a lot meaner and more difficult to deal with. When an effect tells you to \"add 1 (or more) morphings\" you will draw randomly from the Morphing Token pile and place them face up on the Entity. From then on, as long as the Entity has the token, it will apply its effects. See ENTITY: MORPHINGS - s.248.1 for more information.\n\nThe Basic effect is the effect that is triggered the most often. The Basic effect will generally harm nearby Dreamers. In this case, if any Dreamer is in range 1 (in the same or in an adjacent space) when resolving the Basic effect of this Entity, this Dreamer suffers 1 . If you don't remember how works, consult: Dying - s.450.2. In short - if any Dreamer suffers their 8th , they die. And usually this isn't pleasant.\n\nThe Special effect of this Entity has an even greater range of 2. Remember that range may be counted in any direction orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but not diagonally. A space connected diagonally is in range 2 - 1 space vertically and 1 horizontally. In this case, the Special effect Seals 2 cards. For a reminder of how sealing works go to - s.450.2.\n\nIt's a good habit to always look at the Turn card and check what the Entity will do when you end your Dreamers Phase. If it doesn't look good, keep a safe distance or attack to temporarily repel the monster.\n\nSometimes your Dreamers will have other tricks up their sleeves in order to manipulate this card. For example, one of your influence cards (\"Thoughtful Moment\") allows you to \"Seal it in order to block any 1 Step on the current Turn card\". When you do this you can use a to \"block\" a certain effect from happening. This can sometimes get you out of tight spots!\n\nYou've opened a door and revealed 2 tiles - and so many things have changed!

Entities represent the creatures found within the Dreamworld - they are the boogeymen and fairies; some are hostile while others are helpful. All entities act during the DREAMSCAPE PHASE which occurs after Dreamers have performed all their actions and passed.

If the result is , the Entity moves by 1 space, ignoring its Movement value. If the result is , it moves by its full Movement value - in this case, by 4 spaces. If the result is , it moves by its full Movement value and you roll the Movement die again and it moves again.\n\nEntities always move towards the nearest Dreamer unless stated otherwise.

For now, Relocating to any space won't help you much because there is currently only 1 space in the Dreamscape.

        "text": "Through the abyss we crawl, from the cold dark rift out to...somewhere...a green and lush forest.\n\nWhere are we?! What are we doing here? Who are we? Deep down we have the sinking feeling that something has gone wrong ... catastrophically wrong.\n\nVague memories linger as if we were waking from a deep slumber. Each moment they elusively slip through our fingers like grains of sand until eventually there is nothing left but emptiness.\n\nWe hear song birds. We smell wet earth after the rain. Petrichor \u2013 we recall the curious name of this scent. We wander through a maze of forest paths, each too similar to the last for a very long time; our constant companions - dirty torn clothes, burning muscles, a consuming hunger.\n\nMemories of being pursued rise from the depths of our thoughts - before we had barely escaped capture and the fear gnaws at the edge of our minds. Fog rises from the steaming earth. The golden rays of the setting sun shine behind the trees. Beautiful ... if it were not for the creeping darkness and the thing hunting us. We must hurry. Finally, we reach a lea in front of a rock wall with massive gates.\n\nThe imposing gates are locked. There are three locks, each with a symbol identical to that on one of the pedestals next to it \u2013 a leaf, a padlock, a wave. A small tree grows on the first pedestal, a large rusty padlock is attached to the second one, and on the third is a stone ewer from which water flows endlessly. Unconsciously we know that our escape lies through the gate. Now to open it...\n\nThis is the beginning of the tutorial segment. There may seem like there are a lot of rules up ahead (and there are!) but we'll attempt to walk you slowly through it. Let's practice the basics then.\n\nThis is the start of a Dream and you're looking down at a bird's eye view map of the area around you. Each MAP TILE consists of four spaces.\n\nPlace your Dreamer miniatures in (Dreamer's Entrance) spaces. As the symbol straddles two spaces, you may choose either of them. A space can contain at most 4 figures - these are combinations of Dreamer miniatures and/or other miniatures.\n\nA TURN will consist of a DREAMERS PHASE where all Dreamers will draw up to 4 INFLUENCE CARDS from their Influence Deck to their maximum hand size which is typically 6, followed by a DREAMSCAPE PHASE (more on that later). So for example, if you had 3 cards in your hand already at the beginning of the Dreamers Phase you would only draw 3 cards, which brings you to your hand size of 6 cards. Similarly if you had 4 cards, you would only draw 2 cards. Before you draw you may discard any number of cards.\n\nHowever you have no cards in your hand at the moment so DRAW 4 INFLUENCE CARDS NOW.\n\nNow let's look around the map.\n\nYou see 3 pedestals dotted around the Dreamscape tile you're on and on each one you will practice different actions that make up most of the different types of map actions that may appear throughout the game.\n\nOh but we forgot one thing haven't we? How do you get to these spaces first?\n\nIf you look at your hand of cards now you'll notice on the top left they will have a bunch of symbols, namely , , . These represent your Dreamer's inner resources or INTENT to deal with problems:\n\nis your CUNNING and is mainly related to movement, avoidance, cleverness and deception.\n\nis your AWARENESS and is mainly related to diplomacy, conversation, observation, understanding and aptitude with technology.\n\nis your WRATH and is mainly related to physical actions, fighting, tenacity and argument.\n\nMovement\n\nNow to move you will need to discard influence cards with intent on them - one intent for each space of movement. So if you wanted to move your Dreamer 3 spaces you could discard one influence card with 2 intent and another one with 1 intent. These cards go to a personal discard pile (you can keep these face up on the right side of your Dreamer Board) and you get to move your Dreamer miniature to the intended space. Remember that you cannot normally move diagonally. If you decide to move less than the number of intent you spent - this is possible also, but any excess intent is lost. In fact with any of your actions, if you overspend, any excess influence is lost.\n\nNow back to the MAP ACTIONS...\n\nThe green one is a simple action with a cost of 6 . To pay for this you will need to be on this space and then discard Influence cards from your hand for Intent - specifically cards with icons in their top left. So I might discard 2 cards with 2 each (for a total of 4) and 2 more cards with each (for a total of 2) to make up this cost. This all has to be paid in the one action by only one Dreamer. You may find that you need to keep cards from turn to turn in order to have enough intent to pay for this. Once the cost has been paid, you read the relevant entry in the Secret Script.\n\nThe yellow one is an action for 3 but you have to pay it as many times as the number of Dreamers (that's what means) in gradual increments. We call these gradual actions and they are only resolved once the full cost has been met. As before you also need to be on this space to pay the costs.\n\nSo for example if there are 2 Dreamers playing, the total cost of activating the space is 2 x 3 = 6 intent. This can be paid all at once in a single action OR progressively over multiple TURNS in increments of 3 intent, with each payment tracked by a (Yellow marker) placed on the space of the action.\n\nTo illustrate this, on one turn, the Free Spirit might pay 3 intent first to contribute to this (by discarding 3 intent worth of cards from her hand). You place a on the space to represent this. Then on another turn, the Tough Guy, can contribute another 3 to complete the action, reading from the relevant script. Alternatively if you just had 6 intent you could pay it outright and complete the action.\n\nThe red one is an Assault action with a cost of 6 (representing wrath thematically). This special type of action can be performed at a range of 1 (the space itself or an adjacent space but not diagonally). One action which hasn't been featured on this map is the Contact action which is very similar to the Assault action but uses intent instead and also has an action range of 1. Some of your card abilities will only work with Assault or Contact actions. Sometimes you might run into actions with \"red\" or \"green\" words but if they do not mention specifically Assault or Contact they are not these actions.\n\nAdditionally, the actions on the yellow and red pedestals have a icon, which means that they are one-use only \u2013 when performed, place a token on them to mark that they are no longer available.\n\nThere is another action in the lower-left corner of the A2 tile. This one allows you to gain 1 (shining blue gem) for 1 intent. The only limit to how many times you may perform it is the number of available (6) \u2013 treat yourself to all the if you like but this might mean that other Dreamers don't have access to them (if you're playing with others). What are used for? You may use them to reroll any die. Why might you want to roll the di(c)e in the first place? See - s.450.3 - BOOSTING INTENT.\n\nIn the lower-right corner, there is a free action (with a cost of zero) \u2013 you only have to be in this space to use it. There is also a wall close-by - this is an impassable barrier that you can't move through or measure range through.\n\nYou'll also note that some of your cards have abilities on the bottom of them that can be used to pay for Intent. These abilities typically allow you to obtain Intent more efficiently. To read more about how to use card abilities, go to - s.450.1.\n\nNote that there is no set action structure, so feel to take your actions simultaneously to save time - that is, if you're playing with multiple players.\n\nWhen you've run out of things to do (or cards in your hands), all Dreamers will pass and you'll move into the DREAMSCAPE PHASE - go to - s.450.4.\n\nAs this script is a condensed summary of all the rules of the games\uff08with quick links below), we recommend that you write this number (450) down somewhere in case you need to reference it again during play. We may make a glossary of rules soon, maybe?\n\nUsing map actions - s.450\n\nUsing card effects/abilities - s.450.1\n\nSealing/Reshuffling Cards; Dying - s.450.2\n\nBoosting Intent - s.450.3\n\nDreamscape Phase/ Entity Turn - s.450.4",

Nothing here is ordinary. We stay in bizarrely decorated hotels and fortunately nobody asks for payment. Ironically, we have no need to sleep in them - it is however refreshing to feel the walls separating us from the chaos of the dreamworld. Instead we spend our spare time planning our next forays and learning about the locals. We've felt no hunger here either and even though we've tasted many strange foods, have gathered no nourishment from them.\n\nThere are some issues that plague us from time to time \u2013 sometimes our legs refuse to obey, becoming jelly-like at the worst possible moment; sometimes our mouths fuse together like that scene from an old horror film (what was it again?!) and sometimes our belongings mysteriously vanish into thin air only to reappear some time later.\n\nThe buildings here also have a mind of their own - we leave a room and when we come back, a different room has crept in and replaced it, doors and all. Sometimes, peering out the window, new buildings pop up in front of our eyes. People we meet sometimes transform before our eyes, their faces shifting from feature to feature, occasionally changing into someone familiar but not exactly placeable. The sensation of deja-vu occurs very commonly here.\n\nA double-decker taxi stops next to an old, closed market with a sign that reads: \"Everything for free! But only at the highest prices!\" Questioning a few of the strange locals in the area we managed to gain enough cryptic information to know that the one we are seeking - who might be able to help us answer a few questions about this strange city - disappeared a few days ago in this old run down marketplace.\n\nThe taxi driver thanks us and drives away without taking payment. We wonder why the driver spends her days chauffeuring lost souls around. Perhaps like Sisyphus they are compelled into an eternity of toil.\n\nWe easily sneak through a hole in a rusty chain-link fence and start investigating, trying to find clues in the impenetrable darkness...\n\nWhenever you run out of tokens during this Dream and you have to place one, take the token from the furthest space from your Dreamer.\n\n-HINT - What do your Dreamers have that will allow you to illuminate the darkness?

In dreams, we don't have a problem with that - but here in this \"real\" stable world we share with others there are so many barriers to achieving this.\n\nThe Final Frontier - a great challenge, a scientific project that eventually destroyed the world. The results of the study were bleak at first. We were searching for the difference between the world of dreams and what we called reality, and slowly understood that there was no difference. A study by our scientists suggested that the Dream world was less real. What was more surprising was that when the exact research methodology was replicated by scientists on the other side the conclusion was exactly the opposite - that our waking world was \"less real\".\n\nIt looked like we were our own mirror images. The only differences being that our world was more stable and the Dream world possessed greater powers of creation. We were able to move between these two worlds without any problem. However this was not enough for us. We desired to control completely this power of creation. Because it was shared with billions of other dreamers everything here was the average of all that we believed in, what we wanted and what we were afraid of.\n\nAnd then, the ESC developed the first prototype of the Key. The principle was that if you could isolate your part of the dreamworld, you could change it to a limited extent and forcibly bring your dreams into reality. We strengthened our frequencies surpressing those belonging to others and after suffering a miserable beginning, the door was finally opened. The rest was merely a technology race.\n\nCoupled Keys, reinforced Keys, accelerated Keys, i-Keys. Technology quickly became obsession. Everyone wanted to maximise their own individual control over creation and Dreams. This technology was not cheap so ordinary people could not afford even the cheapest and weakest of Keys, becoming slaves of worlds created by others.\n\nReality was greeted with new wonders - bigger with every passing day, grander and more amazing than ever before. It became full of realised dreams. Unfortunately it also resembled the dreamworld more and more. Individual new worlds became so separate that, in the end, nothing distinguished them from ordinary dreams. There was no longer one shared reality - it had fractured into nothing more than countless, infinite microcosms.\n\nSo my belief when it comes to the Great Disaster was that no one really attacked us. It wasn't a meteorite, or sun flares, nor from any divine judgement. This force was too powerful and we weren't ready to control it. It was no one but outselves, in all of our folly and hubris, who destroyed our own world.",

We've turned it into countless, separate dreams - there is nothing else beyond them. No one can predict how long such a state could last - hundreds or thousands of years, because time has been diminished to just another, insignificant dimension.\n\nAnd yet within each shard of reality exist smaller groups of consciousness, inhabitants who try to recreate what was once our lost world with incomplete memories. Fragment by fragment, details being rebuilt limited by their own powers of creation. And on top of this they must defend themselves against interlopers who could destroy their noble efforts, absorbing them into their own dreams.\n\nNow groups of scientists trapped in the bubbles of artificial worlds are trying to find a way to restore the common world through the search for an essential missing element. If we find it, we'll finally be able to restore our forgotten real world step by step, expanding its borders and nullifying the chaotic powers that exist outside. And maybe, just maybe, one day we'll really be home again.\n\nWhere to start our search? Let's start with the most powerful, distinct dream worlds that can trap and transform newcomers. They contain a secret of the lost stability.\n\nIt's a risky mission because, by joining someone's dream you inevitably become part of it. You can easily lose your existing memories, knowledge and turn into just another puppet subject to the will of the ruler of such a world.

In the second half of life, many of us finally realize that there is less time than we would like to have when we begin to see the finish line in sight. Time erodes away our former skills and abilities, our former appearance and we all become a shadow of what we were. The reality hits us that it will never be better again. But can we buy some extra time? Can we find our former selves again?\n\nOf course, we can - the solution is so very obvious! Thanks to Endless Sleep Clinic (ESC) we can achieve what is impossible. Never again will we have to feel the inevitable decay of our mortal shells.\n\nWhen Professor Shelley started the ESC, he was in a wheelchair, and his eyesight was modest but he definitely knew what he was looking for. He also knew that seconds of genuine brightness, moments of happiness, and revelations of truth appear very rarely in ordinary life being difficult to see in the rat race of the waking world. In dreams however, we experience them all the time.\n\nHe noticed that memories of real events and dreams were perceived in the same way by the human mind. Time however moves much slower in dreams, and in a few seconds, you can experience long hours, and in hours - whole weeks. Sleeping is one-third of our human lives, simply wasted because we cannot use these hours properly. In dreams, time and opportunity can be found - we can be ourselves again - or even more - there.\n\nSuch were the early beginnings of the ESC - research, expanding lucid dreaming skills, practicing dream remembering, discovering secrets of strange worlds. And the respondents had more interesting lives there than in their last decades. They visited new worlds, built unforgettable memories, developed new skills, without past pain, without restrictions. Time did not seem to matter. They had never lived like this before.\n\nAnd yet there was one more limit to cross, the final frontier: how could we share our dreams with others?",

Each of us remembered something different and fragmented like pieces of a photograph that fit together all wrong. A laboratory and scientific devices, great fires in the sky and that disturbing newspaper headline - \"Is this the end of the world? How will it end?\".\n\nHas there ever been anything besides this forest? Have we ever done anything other than to wander these woods? Where were we going? Why were we here? We still pushed forward despite being tired of this journey, constantly walking onwards, running away from everything, in our search for... something. Behind us we felt a dark entity pursuing us but we dared not stop.\n\nWhen we left, there were four of us. The fifth joined later, not really knowing where they came from. We all forgot what happened back then. Eventually we left the mists behind and found that we were at the edge of a giant valley. There was a swamp at the bottom of it. We slowly descended the steep slopes, clinging to the trees like children hugging their mothers.\n\nSomething felt immediately wrong. There was something down there. Something that didn't trust us, despised us and didn't want us there. We were intruders after all. The creature followed us, tracking us by scent and the echo of our footsteps. We felt its gaze on our backs. It was there, hiding in the shadows - we were sure of it.\n\nThe sounds of this forest were unsettling. The trees were monstrous, their branches like claws that obscured the sky. The fog returned. After the next hour of walking something else appeared - a strange, disturbing sound. Something was coming for us...\n\nWe went further and managed to climb the mountain. There was a road there like a tunnel in a dense forest. The fog was thinning. When we heard the sound of beating hooves, we quickly hid - just in time too, as strange creatures dashed past us along the road. They were mostly humanoid but with horses' heads and hooves. They seemed formidable and aggressive.\n\nWhen the clatter died down, we pushed on. Little did we know it was to greater peril, as we found out later. One by one, we all became sick. One of us disappeared. I was sure we would find each other again eventually, but it was easy to get lost there. Our memories began to disappear once again.

'now'. None of the strands will ever be broken.\n\nThe combinations are endless and we slowly learned to choose among them moving towards the most desired versions.

We can travel in time and change what we want but only within the unknowable rules of this coherent system.\n\nWe will never go down any path that could really make a difference or create a catastrophic paradox because we will not find that path, because they do not exist.\n\nNobody will ever notice such changes because memory only moves along these threads of time, always assimilating to the current version.\n\nAnd if, by some miracle, you do manage to spot an anomaly - a glitch in the matrix - you can always be sure that sharing this knowledge, in the hopes of changing the world around you, is futile.

This strange connection was the source of endless paradoxes, and impossible to explain.Our entire civilization and technology focused on a single life, but only until the moment of death, trying to cut everything that went beyond the material view of the world.

Everyone seems to remember the same early signs of the reality falling apart and the accumulation of anomalies that occurred before the Great Disaster.\n\nAnd yet it all began with the technology that was supposed to help us all. This path began when the new generations finally accepted a different paradigm of the world - where the new science embraced concepts of endless reincarnation cycles and consciousness as foundations for matter.\n\nWe were no longer just focused on our own singular lifetimes. We wanted to investigate life's true purpose, its expansive experiences, even pushing past the boundaries of death by preserving continuous memory uninterrupted after just mere moments of existence.\n\nAnd if we could influence matter and reality to such a degree - what were our limits? Humanity has never accepted such restrictions.\n\nHowever neither greed nor thirst for power have disappeared. Everyone wanted to buy the power of creation and control it too, of course. Everyone wanted immortality, which was no longer just a vague promise.
